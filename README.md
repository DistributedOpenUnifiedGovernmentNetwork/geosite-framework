================

## Description

Jekyll framework for building spatially-enabled, data-enabled sites.

### CyberGIS
The [Humanitarian Information Unit](http://hiu-beta.state.gov) has been developing a sophisticated geographic computing infrastructure referred to as the CyberGIS. The CyberGIS provides highly available, scalable, reliable, and timely geospatial services capable of supporting multiple concurrent projects.  The CyberGIS relies on primarily open source projects, such as PostGIS, GeoServer, GDAL, GeoGig, OGR, and OpenLayers.  The name CyberGIS is dervied from the term geospatial cyberinfrastructure.

### ROGUE
The Rapid Opensource Geospatial User-Driven Enterprise (ROGUE) Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) is a two-year research & development project developing the technology for distributed geographic data creation and synchronization in a disconnected environement.  This new technology taken altogether is referred to as GeoSHAPE.  See [http://geoshape.org](http://geoshape.org) for more information.  HIU is leveraging the technology developed through ROGUE to build out the CyberGIS into a robust globally distributed infrastruture.
